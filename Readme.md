# CSC3150_Projects

This repository includes the five projects of the course CSC3150 (operating system), CUHKSZ. For the details of each project, please refer to the report pdf of each project.

My coding skill is not be good enough, though I got full marks for all projects except the 4th one (I get 5 points reduced in the 4th project). The codes in the projects may need further refinement.

If you are a CS (or CE) student in CUHKSZ, you are welcomed to refer to my code, but you need to keep in mind that the school has some strict rules regarding plagiarism. If you find my code need to be improved, feel free to help me to refine the code.
